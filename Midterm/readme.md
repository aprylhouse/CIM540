Apryl House, CIM540 Midterm Project 

As a creative advertising major, an essential part to acquiring and internship and career is having a well built portfolio. For this project I will focus on creating an interactive and playful portfolio. The code that follows is for the welcome and closing of my portfolio. I view this code as a preliminary foundation for my portfolio in that uses frame animation, arrays, counters, millis and a few other techniques. Once my coding skills and knowledge have advanced I will build off this code to add my actual pieces of work to this interactive portfolio as my final project.
